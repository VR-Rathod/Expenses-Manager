                    <p class="fade-in">For an equal split, if you spend a total of 3000 with 3 friends, each person owes 1000. For an exact split, if the total is 4299 and you need to divide it as 799, 2000, and 1500 respectively, this will be accurately calculated. For a percentage split, if you owe 50% of the total and others cover the remaining 50%, the application ensures all percentages sum up to 100%.</p>
